Wiki-Confluence

This is an experimental module to process the XML dump of an
Atlassian/Confluence Wiki space.

The dump contains a sequence of <object> elements which represent the
components of the Wiki content.  Most important pars are

  <object class=Page>
  <object class=BodyContent>

which represent individual pages and the actual content of the page.

STATUS AND GOALS

Right now, the script cfl1.pl only separates each object into a temprary
file tree under ./tmp/<object-class>/<object-id> while also creating a
datastructre which resembles a "Page Tree".  This page tree contains
information about the wiki space.  The page tree should be used in a
second pass to transcribe the content in a format for offline usage,
e.g. EPUB.  Gollum also seem to be a viable option.  Since the XML
dump contains the page history as well, importing the pages into a
version control system (e.g. git for use with Gollum) seems to be
possible.  Right now I'm exploring ways to synchronzie the contents
bidirectionally...
